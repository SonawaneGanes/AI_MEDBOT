🩺 AI Doctor Chatbot – Model Training Pipeline
This project trains a machine learning model to assist an AI-powered medical chatbot in predicting diseases based on user symptoms. 
The model is built using a Decision Tree classifier and trained on a structured medical dataset. 
It is designed to integrate seamlessly with a frontend chatbot and backend API.


 
🧠 Why This Structure Works
- 🔁 Modular: separates frontend, backend, ML, and config
- 🧪 Testable: supports local model testing and API calls
- 🚀 Deployable: ready for Supabase, Vercel, or Railway
- 📊 Scalable: easy to add new datasets, models, or endpoints

Let me know if you want to add:
- ✅ Docker setup for backend
- ✅ Model versioning and logging
- ✅ Supabase database schema for storing user queries or predictions
You’re building a production-grade AI system — this structure sets you up for success.
